title: "Lab 12: Pong"
...


# Attendance

We will be taking roll in lab each week! Please come to your assigned lab to be counted present!

Each lab TAs are empowered to select their own method of taking roll.
Please follow your lab TA's instructions.  
They may dock points if you  are excessively late or leave unusually early.

# Pairing

For this and all subsequent labs, you will work in pairs.

You should have a partner for the game project already selected.  If not, pair with one in lab today.
The game project will be due the last day of class.
You'll need to work with your partner to get it designed and implemented by then.

# Activity

Today we are doing an example game in gamebox; specifically the classic game *Pong*.
If you are unfamiliar with Pong, head over to [http://www.ponggame.org/](http://www.ponggame.org/) to see what it's all about.

We'll play by a basic version of the rules:

-   There is a ball that bounces back and forth.
-   Move your paddle on your side of the screen to prevent it from getting past you.
-   If it gets past you, your opponent earns a point.
-   First player to 10 points wins.

After you've figured out how the game plays, copy the following files and code into a new Python file in the same directory as your `gamebox.py` file:

-   [gamebox.py](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/code/gamebox/gamebox.py)
-   [pong.py](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/code/gamebox/pong.py)
-   [paddle.wav](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/code/gamebox/paddle.wav)
-   [wall.wav](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/code/gamebox/wall.wav)

## Finish `pong.py`

If you run the game as is, you should see what the game will look like, but nothing actually works.
We have left comments in the `pong.py` file that describes the code you need to add to make the game work.
Add some code, try it out, and keep going until you have a working Pong game!


## Submission

**At least one partner** should submit one .py file named `pong.py` to Archimedes (the submission system):
[https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/](https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/).
Please put **all partners' ids** in comments at the top of the file.
