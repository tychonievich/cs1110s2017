title: "Lab 1: Installing Python and PyCharm"
...

Lab this week is optional in that we will not be taking roll.
However, this is an opportunity to come to ensure that you have Python and PyCharm installed and working properly on your laptops. 
If you do not come to lab, we will assume you have taken care of this yourself and you are ready to go when we start coding in lecture next week. 
So, if you have any doubts, come on down to lab, meet some of the TAs, and make sure you're laptop is setup and ready to go!

# First PyCharm run

To verify that your installation worked,

1. Run PyCharm

2. Accept the default options in the various screens that pop up asking you to set up various aspects of PyCharm.
    These should only appear the first time you run PyCharm.

3.  When you reach the welcome screen

    ![Pycharm welcome screen](files/pycharm-splash.png)
    
    select "Create new project".
    
    If you have already created a project, it will show up on the welcome screen; select it instead of creating a new one.
    
4.  In the new project screen
    
    ![Pycharm new project screen](files/pycharm-new.png)
    
    Pick a folder location for the project that you can find again;
    all of the files you create in this class will go inside that folder,
    and you'll need to upload some of them to the course website.
    
    Also make sure the "Interpreter" option is set to some version of Python 3 (probably Python 3.6; sorry that the picture is a little old and shows 3.4).

With that you are up and running.
Feel free to continue reading about PyCharm in [our revised version of chapter 2.2](revised2.2.html) if you wish.
