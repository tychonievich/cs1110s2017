# Overview

Your task is to use PyGame and gamebox to create in interesting game with a partner.
Unlike other assignments,

-   You should work with one (1) partner for the entirety of this assignment
-   This assignment is worth more points (see [the syllabus](syllabus.html) for details)
-   You are free to define the details of this assignment yourselves.

# Partnering

## Recording a partner.

Create a "new file" in PyCharm named `partner.txt`.  In it put *only* the computing ID and name of your partner, like so:

````
lat7h
Luther Tychonievich
````

Submit it as one of your files for this assignment on [Archimedes](https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/).
This assignment lets you submit several files; this is one of them.

The due date for `partner.txt` is Thursday 13 April 2017 (lab that day will help you if you don't have one before then).
You and your partner *must* both have each other's IDs in your submitted `partner.txt`s by Friday morning.

If you want to work alone or need a group of three, your lab TA (or Professor Dill for 1111) can help you understand how to submit that.

Preferably, you'll pick a partner within your same lab section, but that is not strictly required.

## Working together

To the degree possible, please plan to work together, rather than each working independently and combining code later.
Working together can result in fewer bugs and better code.

If you have problems with your partner, first bring them up to your partner and then to your instructor.
We'll do our best to help things run smoothly.

We will also ask for each student to submit a partner evaluation near the end of your time together.

# Designing your game

Each game is expected to be unique; we do not tell you what to implement.
However, we do provide some guidelines to keep the scope appropriate:

## Required Features

You must include all of the following:

User Input
:   Either through the keyboard or mouse, you should have appropriate and working user controls.

Graphics/Images
:   You should use some appropriate images in your game.

Start Screen
:   Game has a start screen with game name, student names (and IDs), and basic game instructions.

## Optional Features

You must include at least four of the following:

Animation
:   Use a sprite sheet to have an animated character.

Enemies
:   Have characters that can hinder the player character from accomplishing the goal.

Collectables
:   Add collectables (i.e. coins) to the level that can be picked up by the character with a counter that appears on the screen.

Scrolling level
:   Make it so you can keep going off the screen! (You may need to add a background image to make this more obvious.)

Timer
:   Have a countdown (or count up) timer for your game.

Health meter
:   Have a health meter that changes as you hit enemies/obstacles.

Music/Sound effects
:   Have some good sound design.

Two players simultaneously
:   Two players who are able to interact with one another within the game.



Game Ideas

Having trouble coming up with a game idea? Try one of these! Or make a variation of one of these!

    Frogger - Can you get the frog across the road without getting hit by a car? Frogger on SmashingArcade
    Pac-Man - This classic game is completely reasonable to pull off! Pac-Man on SmashingArcade
    Keep-Away - Build a game where you character has to keep from getting "tagged" by other characters running around the level!

And many, many more! We will add more here in coming days and feel free to ask for suggestions too!

NOTE: Your game CANNOT just be an extension of example code that we provide you. You MUST show some creativity and do something on your own! The game can be based on other existing games (like the ones listed above) and you can use snipits of example code in your game, but you cannot just start from an example file and add on trivial features.
Submission

Unlike all the other submissions, this one needs to go to Collab since you may be turning in images, audio, etc. Make sure you game is called game.py and is in its own folder with all the game assets (images, audio) along with gamebox.py. Zip/archive this entire directory and submit that along with a .txt document describing what your game is, what your features are that you want us to grade, and how to play it. TAs that can't figure out how to play your game will definitely give you a low score!

ONLY ONE PARTNER SHOULD SUBMIT! PLEASE DO NOT DOUBLE SUBMIT YOUR PROJECT!!!

Partner Evals: Please fill out this evaluation form for your partner! - https://goo.gl/forms/qiUGmnJnveI8dsOK2
