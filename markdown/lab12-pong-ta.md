...


# Project partners

View the set of registered partners for your lab section at
<https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/partners.php>.
Help match up those who are not yet matched.
The list of partners should live-update immediately as they submit `partner.txt` (with a refresh).

If someone wishes to work alone, verify that they understand they will not be held to a lower standard than pairs and then tell them to enter *themselves* as their partner.

If you have an odd number of unmatched people (and only if you do),
you can grant permission for one group of 3; have them each list two partners, like so:

    lat7h
    Luther Tychonievich
    up3f
    Upsorn Praphamontripong

## Finish `pong.py`

There are many comments in `pong.py` that should help them make progress on this assignment.
