title: Introduction to Programming -- Spring 2017
...

# Overview

Welcome! In this course, we have two main goals - to teach you the skill of programming and the art of computer science. Having the ability to write and understand simple programs has become increasingly more important. The concepts and principles you pick up in this class will give you the ability to take an algorithm or problem in your chosen field and write a program that will help you do your job quicker, easier, and more reliably.

## Swapping Labs and Waiting Lists

For CS 1110, SIS will show you as on the waiting list for the lecture if you are on the waiting list for the lab.
It handled waiting lists by lab section, since lab space is a constraining factor in how many students we can enroll.

If you attempt to swap lab sections in SIS, expect to end up on the back of the waiting list for that section.

# Other *Introduction to Programming* Offerings

CS 1110 and CS 1111 are both "general" introductions to programming, providing an overview of topics suitable for all majors.
There are also other Introduction to Programming offerings at UVa:

CS 1112
:   Covers the same material as CS 1110/1111,
    but is organized based on the assumption that *none* of the students have any prior programming experience.
    By contrast, CS 1110 assumes *most* students have no prior programming experience;
    CS 1111 assumes *all* students do have prior programming experience.

CS 1113
:   Covers the same core material as CS 1110/1111, but is designed for engineers,
    pulling examples and assignments from common engineering domains
    and teaching some tools and techniques engineers are likely to find useful.

Placement Test
:   If you have programmed before, you can likely place out of *Introduction to Programming* entirely.
    Placement tests are offered in the CS department offices (Rice 527); no appointment is necessary.
    If you pass the placement test, we advise taking CS 2110 to expand your programming ability further.

Two other courses (CS 1120 and a different flavor of CS 1113) present a more mathematical or scientific introduction to computing, but are not being offered this semester.
