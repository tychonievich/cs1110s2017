title: "Lab 3: Counting Squares"

# Attendance

We will be taking roll in lab each week! Please come to your assigned lab to be counted present!

Each lab TAs are empowered to select their own method of taking roll.
Please follow your lab TA's instructions.  
They may dock points if you  are excessively late or leave unusually early.


# Pairing

For this and all subsequent labs, you will work in pairs.

We will use a model called "pair programming" in this class. There are a
few things to know about successful pairing under this model:

-   **2 minds, 1 focus**. If at any point the two of you are doing
    distinct things, such as each typing on your own computer or each
    looking at your own piece of paper, then you are not pairing
    properly.
-   **Driver and Navigator**. At any given point in time, one partner
    will be the "driver", controlling the keyboard, pencil, or other
    tool currently being used. The other will be the "navigator,"
    observing and commenting on the driver's actions
-   **Equality and Communication**. Driver and navigator are equal
    partners; the ideas of both are equally important, and both should
    talk, both should listen when the other speaks, and both should
    treat the other's ideas with respect.
-   **Switch Roles**. Which partner is driving should change at least
    every 15-20 minutes, if not more often.

Pairing in this model has many advantages both from a productivity and
learning standpoint. One of these is generally an increase the intensity
of focus, which can get tiring. Feel free to take breaks every now and
then, but try not to distract other pairs during your breaks.

# Art Contest

Your goal with this lab is to make the *neatest picture you can* using
the turtle and any example code we have provided. You can use any of the
code posted on the lecture notes as a starting point, or you can use
your own.

Make sure to look at the Turtle API
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).
(Remember: the API is the "list of things that you can do")

# Submission

Save a picture of your image by doing *one* of the following:

-   Taking a screenshot and then cropping down to just your image.
    Please save as a PNG (`.png`) file.

-   Use the following code immediately before the `turtle.mainloop()` line to save a Postrcript file (`.ps`):
    
    ````python
    turtle._GetScreen()._canvas.postscript(filename="930-OLS-mst3k-mst3k.ps", colormode="color")
    ````

Submit either a `.png` file or a `.ps` file to the Turtle Art Gallery on Dropbox:
[https://www.dropbox.com/request/LmzdkiDLx8bbnwiDy0VT](https://www.dropbox.com/request/LmzdkiDLx8bbnwiDy0VT).
Make sure to title your file like this:

`930-OLS-lat7h-up3f.png`

Use 930, 1100, 1230, 200, 330, 500, or 630
along with either OLS or MEC for your lab location
so we can keep all the labs together and we know who you are!

Then put in BOTH of your computing IDs, separated by dashes.

Images will be displayed (anonymously).
The staff will pick our favorite images, with prizes awarded next lab!
