# Which CS 111x should I take?

All of the CS 111x courses provide a full introduction to programming sufficient to take additional CS courses.
Students who took all versions perform comparably in CS 2110.

CS 1110
:   A general section, designed to teach as many students as possible.
    Most who take this course have no prior programming experience.

CS 1110 and CS 1111 are both "general" introductions to programming, providing an overview of topics suitable for all majors.
There are also other Introduction to Programming offerings at UVa:

CS 1112
:   Covers the same material as CS 1110/1111,
    but is organized based on the assumption that *none* of the students have any prior programming experience.
    By contrast, CS 1110 assumes *most* students have no prior programming experience;
    CS 1111 assumes *all* students do have prior programming experience.

CS 1113
:   Covers the same core material as CS 1110/1111, but is designed for engineers,
    pulling examples and assignments from common engineering domains
    and teaching some tools and techniques engineers are likely to find useful.

Placement Test
:   If you have programmed before, you can likely place out of *Introduction to Programming* entirely.
    Placement tests are offered in the CS department offices (Rice 527); no appointment is necessary.
    If you pass the placement test, we advise taking CS 2110 to expand your programming ability further.

Two other courses (CS 1120 and a different flavor of CS 1113) present a more mathematical or scientific introduction to computing, but are not being offered this semester.


# The course is listed as restricted!

CS courses are open to students in all majors, but for the initial periods of registration (indicated below) many are restricted to students in majors that require the course.

|Course|Start of registration|17-Apr-2017[^when]|19-Apr-2017[^when]|08-Aug-2017[^when][^june]|
|------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
|1010|Open to non-SEAS students||||
|1110 and 1111|Open to SEAS students, CLAS 1st year students, and Math or Cog Sci majors|Open to all|||
|1112|Permission of instructor||||
|1113|Open to SEAS 1st years only (during summer orientation)||||
|2102|Open to CS BA, CS BS, CPE and CogSci majors|Also open to SEAS 1st or 2nd years, CLAS 1st or 2nd years|Open to all||
|2110|Open to CS BA, CS BS, CPE, EE, System, and CogSci majors|Also open to SEAS 1st or 2nd years, CLAS 1st or 2nd years|Open to all|

|4970|Permission of instructor||||
|not listed here|Open to CS BS, CS BA, and CPE majors|Also open to CS minors and CogSci majors||Open to all|

[^when]: The CS Department has no control over the exact time that restrictions ease on April 17 and 19 and Aug. 8!

[^pdr]: For info on CS2150 registration, please see: <http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/cs2150.php>

[^june]: To allow students who may become majors in June and also transfer students a chance to enroll, these courses will open to all after summer orientation ends.  Please do not email individual instructors to ask for an exception, since itâ€™s important we treat all non-majors in this situation the same way.

If you are not eligible to sign up for a full course, you cannot get on the waiting list. But, put yourself on the waiting list as soon as you can, because at the start of the term, waiting lists often shrink and many students do eventually get in.
