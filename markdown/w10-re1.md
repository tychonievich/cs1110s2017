# Beta-draft Writeup

This homework writeup is in beta, posted for the review of course staff.
We will not add new parts to it, but might remove some elements prior to the due date.
Doing it in its current form will not hurt you, but know that it might change to be smaller before it is due (or it might not; we're still waiting for TA feedback).

# Task

Write a python file called `regexes.py` that defines several variables containing compiled regular expressions,
as follows:

-   `nospace =`{.python} a regular expression that matches one or more non-space characters.

    `CS1110-001/smile` should match, as should `!`
    
    `hi there` should not match, nor should the empty string.

-   `email_name =`{.python} a regular expression that matches commonly accepted names for email addresses, which must be at least one character long and be made up of

    -   uppercase and lowercase Latin letters `A` to `Z` and `a` to `z`;
    -   digits `0` to `9`;
    -   special characters `+-_`
    -   dot `.`, provided that it is not the first or last character, and provided also that it does not appear consecutively (e.g. `John..Doe` is not allowed)
    
    `mst3k` should match, as should `+3o-___26` and `t.j`
    
    `t.j.` should not match

-   `quotation =`{.python} a regular expression that matches text beginning and ending with a `"`, with no internal `"`, where the first and last character inside the quotes are not spaces.
    
    `"hi there"` should match
    
    `" hi there"` should not match, nor should `"hi there "` or `"I said "hi" just now"`.

-   `twonum =`{.python} a regular expression that matches pairs of numbers, separated by a space, comma, or both.
    Accept both numbers with and without decimal places, and allow an optional preceding `-` on each number.
    If there is a decimal place, there must be at least one digit on each side of it.
    
    Additionally, each of the two numbers (with the `-` if present) should be a group after a match.
    
    `3,4`, `3.0, 4.5`, and `-3.14159265 1110` should all match.
    
    `3.4.5, 1`, `1 Â  2`, and `3 - 4` should not match.
    

-   `likely_name =`{.python} a regular expression that matches one common full name pattern:
    two or three consecutive capitalized runs of letters, separated by spaces.
    A capital letter and a period can serve as a name except in the last position.
    
    `Thomas Jefferson` should match, as should `Edmund Jennings Randolph`, `J. Pierpont Finch`, and `T. Jefferson`
    
    `T Jefferson`, `Thomas J.`, and `Flannery O'Connor` should not match.
    

# Testing your code

When you run `regexs.py`, nothing should happen.
It defined variables, it does not define functions or run anything.

If in another file you enter the following

````python
import regexs

text = '''
CS1110-001/smile ! hi there
mst3k +3o-___26 t.j t.j.
"hi there" but not " hi there" or "hi there " or "I said "hi" just now"
3,4, 3.0, 4.5 and -3.14159265 1110 but not 3.4.5, 1 or 1   2 or 3 - 4
Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Jennings Randolph and J. Pierpont Finch and T. Jefferson
but not T Jefferson or Thomas J. or Flannery O'Connor
'''

def full_match(regex, text):
    '''Gives a list of all complete matches'''
    ans = []
    for match in regex.finditer(text):
        ans.append(match.group(0))
    return ans

ns = full_match(regexs.nospace, text)
print('nospace:',
    'CS1110-001/smile' in ns,
    '!' in ns,
    'hi there' not in ns,
    '' not in ns)

en = full_match(regexs.email_name, text)
print('email_name:',
    'mst3k' in en,
    '+3o-___26' in en,
    't.j' in en,
    't.j.' not in en)

q = full_match(regexs.quotation, text)
print('quotation:',
    '"hi there"' in q,
    '" hi there"' not in q,
    '"hi there "' not in q,
    '"I said "hi" just now"' not in q)

tn = full_match(regexs.twonum, text)

print('twonum:',
    '3,4' in tn,
    '3.0, 4.5' in tn,
    '-3.14159265 1110' in tn,
    '3.4.5, 1' not in tn,
    '1   2' not in tn,
    '3 - 4' not in tn)

for match in regexs.twonum.finditer(text):
    if match.group(0) == '3,4':
        print('  match1:', '3' in match.groups(), '4' in match.groups())
    if match.group(0) == '-3.14159265 1110':
        print('  match2:', '-3.14159265' in match.groups(), '1110' in match.groups())

ln = full_match(regexs.likely_name, text)
print('likely_name:',
    'Thomas Jefferson' in ln,
    'Edmund Jennings Randolph' in ln,
    'J. Pierpont Finch' in ln,
    'T. Jefferson' in ln,
    'T Jefferson' not in ln,
    'Thomas J.' not in ln,
    "Flannery O'Connor" not in ln)
````

then that file, when run, should print all `True`{.python}:

````
nospace: True True True True
email_name: True True True True
quotation: True True True True
twonum: True True True True True True
  match1: True True
  match2: True True
likely_name: True True True True True True True
````
