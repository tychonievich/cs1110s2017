add two two-digit numbers, assuming we can add single-digit number only

	  1
	  13
	+ 98
	----
	   1

stack the numbers, line up the last digits
add digits in the right column
if sum is ≥ 10:
	write the 1s digit of the sum in the right column
	write a 1 in the 10s digit column above the other numbers
else:
	put sum in right column of answer
end if

if there are two digits in the left column:
	add digits in the left column
	if sum is ≥ 10:
		write the 1s digit of the sum in the next-to-right column
		write a 1 in the 100s digit column of the answer
	else:
		put sum in next-to-right column of answer
	end if
else:
	add bottom two digits in the left column
	if sum is ≥ 10:
		write the 1 + 1s digit of the sum in the next-to-right column
		write a 1 in the 100s digit column of the answer
	else:
		add one to the sum
		if sum is ≥ 10:
			write the 1 + 1s digit of the sum in the next-to-right column
			write a 1 in the 100s digit column of the answer
		else:
			put sum in next-to-right column of answer
	end if

define ones(a, b):
	to be the 1s place of the sum of a and b

define tens(a, b):
	to be the 10s place of the sum of a and b


let x be ones(the two numbers first digit)

----

Call the 1s place the first digit, the 10s place the and digit, and so on

write pseudocode to describe if you should bring an umbrella to school

don't bring an umbrella

if it is raining when you leave
	bring and umbrella
else
	don't


roll a die
if the roll was 1, 2, or 3
	bring and umbrella
if it was 4, 5, or 6
	don't
otherwise
	play the lottery

start with x = day of month you were born
start with y = 0
while x ≠ 1:
	add one to y
	if x is odd
		replace x with x times 3 plus 1
			x × (3 + 1)
			(x × 3) + 1
	else
		replace x with x ÷ 2
tell your neighbor your value of y
replace x with 3

x = 3	10	5	16	8	4	2	1
y = 0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7



an algorithm is	a finite set of unambiguous steps that runs in finite time
